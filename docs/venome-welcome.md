The [ venome-welcome.md ](..venome-welcome.md) contains a user guide for those new to Venome. It will go through the features of our website, how to set up an account, and how to submit a protein model for review and publishing. 

**1. Welcome to the Website!**

When you first visit Venome, you will be directed to our home page. This home page contains a few different links for navigating our site.

From the home page, you can see a few featured proteins from our database. These are some of many interactive 3D models. More can be found by clicking "Search for Venom Proteins."

Venome is also home to interactive articles about the site history, proteins, research, and other interesting information. This can be accessed by clicking "Read Interactive Articles." 

Not only can you view proteins on our site, you can upload your own! Venome has a request process for users to upload their own proteins and articles. When a user uploads a protein, an administrative user will review the model. Once this review is complete, the protein model is added to the Venome database and can be seen on the site. 

Venome is open source! All of the code for Venome can be found on GitHub. To learn more, click "Completely Open Source." 

**2. Setting up an Account**

To sign up for a Venome account, click "Login" in the top right corner. This will prompt you to enter a username, a valid email to be associated with your account, and a password. 

The next time you visit Venome, log in with these same credentials to access your account!

**3. Submitting a Protein**

Venome uses .pdb files for its proteins. These are stored in our database. To create an upload request, click "Request" in the top left corner next to "Proteins" and "Articles." 

From there, enter information about your protein model. Include a name for the model, a short description, the species from which the venom came, and the .pdb file for your protein. 

Once your request has been created, a user with admin permissions can review the protein and approve it to be uploaded to the site.
