![Github Actions CI tests](https://github.com/xnought/venome/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A website to store, visualize, and analyze venom proteins.

In collaboration with the [Venom Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://venombiochemistrylab.weebly.com/) at Oregon State University 🦫.

## ️⚡️ Quick Start

This section tells you how to run the Venome website in four easy steps.

**1. Install Docker**

A quick way to install Docker is by installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). 


**2. Build the Website**

Execute the [`run.sh`](./run.sh) script in your terminal with the command

```bash
./run.sh start
```

**3. Setup the Database**

Set up the database schema with 

```bash
./run.sh sql_source backend/init.sql
```

**4. View the website**

🎉🥳 You're done! Go to http://localhost:5173 to see the website live.


**(optional data upload)**

Optionally you can upload all the venom lab proteins by running

```bash
./run.sh add_venom_lab_proteins
```
you will have to have python and `pip3 install requests` for this step.

### Local Development Environment

If you would like to have autocomplete and other nice development features, keep reading.

We use VSCode for all development and make sure to download a few extensions like

- Ruff code formatter (for backend)
- Prettier code formatter (for frontend)
- Svelte (for frontend)
- Python (for backend)

for a better experience. Then to get autocomplete with those languages, you'll need to manually install the packages that have already been installed in the docker, but locally. Otherwise your VSCode won't know how to autocomplete. 

First install the [Poetry Python Package Manager](https://python-poetry.org/) by doing 

```bash
pip3 install poetry
```

Then install the packages listed under [`pyproject.toml`](./backend/pyproject.toml) by doing 

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true # required for the .venv to get created
poetry install
```

Then install frontend packages

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
```
