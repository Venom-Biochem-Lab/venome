## Dev Quick Start

This section tells you how to run the Venome website in five easy steps.

**1. Install Docker**

A quick way to install Docker is by installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

**2. Setup Environment Variable**

Create the secret key needed to encode user passwords by executing the
[`run.sh`](./run.sh) script in your terminal with the command

```bash
  ./run.sh create_secret [YOUR_KEY_HERE]
```

**3. Build the Website**

Start the server with

```bash
./run.sh start
```

**4. Setup the Database**

Load the existing data and database schema with

```bash
./run.sh reload_from_backup backups/v0.0.3
```

**5. View the website**

ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ You're done! Go to http://localhost:5173 to see the website live.

**(optional addons)**

You can also add foldseek similarity search and TM Alignment with

```bash
./run.sh add_foldseek
./run.sh add_tmalign
```

### Local Development Environment

If you would like to have autocomplete and other nice development features, keep reading.

We use VSCode for all development and make sure to download a few extensions like

- Ruff code formatter (for backend)
- Prettier code formatter (for frontend)
- Svelte (for frontend)
- Python (for backend)

for a better experience. Then to get autocomplete with those languages, you'll need to manually install the packages that have already been installed in the docker, but locally. Otherwise your VSCode won't know how to autocomplete.

First install the [Poetry Python Package Manager](https://python-poetry.org/) by doing

```bash
pip3 install poetry
```

Then install the packages listed under [`pyproject.toml`](./backend/pyproject.toml) by doing

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true # required for the .venv to get created
poetry install
```

Then install frontend packages

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
```
