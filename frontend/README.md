# Frontend

In [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) which uses the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) JavaScript framework which makes frontend work really freaking easy and great for visualizations.

Here are [tutorials](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte) if you are interested, you'll find it simpler than regular JavaScript and much faster than other frameworks like React.

`cd frontend`, then

```bash
yarn #installs node_modules
yarn dev --open # open up localhost:5173 dev environment in the browser
```
